# MotherBear Dashboard

The MotherBear Dashboard was created as a senior seminar project that would allow Kutztown students (home of the Golden Bears) the ablility to view helpful tid bits about their day, and prepare them for class.

The Dashboard was designed to allow modular components to be added as student needs changed and grew. We developed a few base components including the weather, time and schedule pictured below.

Additional components like the quote of the day would allow the student to add their own personal flare to their dashboard.
